To run:

1. Make sure everything is in the SAME folder. It doesn't matter where this folder is, but if it's not, it will get angry. This means it either will error out, or endlessly attempt to load. We've seen both, we don't want you to see either.

2. Open MARS4_5.jar from the folder.

3. Open main.asm

4. Under the settings dropdown, make sure "Initialize Program Counter to global 'main' if defined" is checked. It will get angry if you don't.

5. Assemble the program by hotkey or button.

6. Press the big green play (run) button.

7. Best of luck getting that high score!


Troubleshooting:
If you get the error: "Error in: Invalid program counter value: 0", you didn't complete set 4. Go back and do step 4. I told you it'd get angry.

Currently supported on:
- Anything that can run MARS correctly (Mac, Windows).

Limitation: Linux does not play well with the one time we found someone with it to try.
